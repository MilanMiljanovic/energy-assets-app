## Introduction

This project is a frontend challenge for an Angular developer role. It involves creating a web app where users can view energy asset timeseries data on a chart and in a table. The application uses Angular for the frontend, Apache ECharts for the charts, and css for styling.

## Technologies

- Angular (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.7
- Apache ECharts

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Angular CLI (v12 or later)

## Instructions

To log into the app, use the following information

email: milan@gmail.com
password: password123

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
